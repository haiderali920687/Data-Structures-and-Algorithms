# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
- This repository includes all the Data Structures and Algorithms I have learned and explored till Now!

# What are Data Structures?
- Data Structures are the structured and organized way of storing data so that it can be used efficiently.

# What is an Algorithm?
- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input and produces a desired output. For example,
An algorithm to add two numbers:

- 1-Take two number inputs
- 2-Add numbers using the '+' operator
- 3-Display the result

# Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?
- 1-Increases your code efficiency.
- 2-It improves your logic building, time and space complexity of your code.
- 3-Improves Code optimization.

``` cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  while(true)
  {
  cout<<"Haider Ali is learning Data Structures and Algorithm";
  }
}
```
